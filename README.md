# PlayerPhysicsSync Example Project (Unity / PUN 2)
This project is designed as a general example/template to perform player physics synchronization over the network
This code was originally based on the code posted by JOE BEST-ROTHERAY on his blog, https://www.codersblock.org/blog/client-side-prediction-in-unity-2018

It is based on the code I used in my game Jelly Brawl: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1278350/Jelly_Brawl/
And is what I am refrencing in the Tutorial video I did on the subject: *INSERT LINK*

In the example I use the PUN 2 api for sending data. However, this can easily be applied to any standard networking library.
I have commented throughout the code marking where you need to apply your game's logic as well as possible places for modifications and improvements.
Hopefully this example can benefit someone.
